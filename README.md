# mysql_spring_demo
This prject I have created to understand the communication between two microservcies.
I wanted to create two microservice one which fetches data from backend mysql service and shows json form. 
I came accross spring boot example and tried on local setup. This project I have taken from spring.io website for leanring pourpose.
